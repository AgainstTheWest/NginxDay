# Context
We had been given this exploit from our sister group, BrazenEagle, who had been developing is for some weeks. Or atleast since Spring4Shell came out.
We are still in the early stages of usage and understanding it, as BE are working on another vendor vulnerabiliy.

Regarding the finite details about it, we recommend you check out this tweet:

GitWorm was allowed to share that information with permission from our DMs.
This README file will be updated as more information regarding this vuln comes to light.
